# Noughts and Crosses (Python)

A lightweight, two‑player noughts and crosses (tic‑tac‑toe) game built with Python and Tkinter. The app presents a 3×3 grid, tracks turns between Player 1 and Player 2, detects wins across rows/columns/diagonals, and reports draws once the board fills.

## How to Run
```bash
python nought_and_crosses_python/noughts_and_crosses_gui.py
```

## Project Layout
- `nought_and_crosses_python/noughts_and_crosses_gui.py`: main Tkinter GUI and game logic.
- `nought_and_crosses_python/*.png`: image assets for the board and player marks.

## Notes
- No build step or dependencies beyond standard Python + Tkinter.
- Image filenames are referenced in code; update the `PICS` list if you rename assets.
